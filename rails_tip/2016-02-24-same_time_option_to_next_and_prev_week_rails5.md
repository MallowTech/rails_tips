Support for same_time option to next_week and prev_week

In Rails 4.x next_week returns beginning of next week and prev_week returns beginning of previous week.

In Rails 4.x these two methods also accept week day as a parameter.

```ruby
  Time.current
  => Fri, 12 Feb 2016 08:53:31 UTC +00:00

  Time.current.next_week
  => Mon, 15 Feb 2016 00:00:00 UTC +00:00

  Time.current.next_week(:tuesday)
  => Tue, 16 Feb 2016 00:00:00 UTC +00:00

  Time.current.prev_week(:tuesday)
  => Tue, 02 Feb 2016 00:00:00 UTC +00:00
```

By using week day as parameter we can get the date one week from now but the returned date is still the beginning of that date. How do we get one week from the current time.

Rails 5 add an additional option same_time: true to solve this problem.

Using this option, we can now get next week date from the current time.

```ruby
  Time.current
  => Fri, 12 Feb 2016 09:15:10 UTC +00:00

  Time.current.next_week
  => Mon, 15 Feb 2016 00:00:00 UTC +00:00

  Time.current.next_week(same_time: true)
  => Mon, 15 Feb 2016 09:15:20 UTC +00:00

  Time.current.prev_week
  => Mon, 01 Feb 2016 00:00:00 UTC +00:00

  Time.current.prev_week(same_time: true)
  => Mon, 01 Feb 2016 09:16:50 UTC +00:00
```

In addition to that, Rails % has come with some features...

We can check whether the given date is Weekends or not.

```ruby
  Time.current
  => Fri, 12 Feb 2016 09:15:10 UTC +00:00
  
  Time.current.on_weekend?
  => false
  
  Time.current.tomorrow
  => Sat, 12 Feb 2016 09:15:10 UTC +00:00
    
  Time.current.tomorrow.on_weekend?
  => true
```

Similar to that we can check the Weekdays.

```ruby
  Time.current
  => Fri, 12 Feb 2016 09:15:10 UTC +00:00
  
  Time.current.on_weekday?
  => true
  
  Time.current.tomorrow
  => Sat, 12 Feb 2016 09:15:10 UTC +00:00
    
  Time.current.tomorrow.on_weekend?
  => false
```

We can get the number of days in a Year with `Time.day_in_year` method.

```ruby
  Time.days_in_year
  => 366
  
  Time.days_in_year(2015)
  => 365
```
